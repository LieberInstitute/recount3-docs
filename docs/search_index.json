These two raw files power the whole recount3 ecosystem. In recount3, we have provided coverage count files for several human and mouse annotations with samples grouped by study. Some large studies, like GTEx and TCGA have been fragmented at the tissue level to make the data more accessible. Figure 1.1: Overview of the data available in recount2 and recount3. Reads (pink boxes) aligned to the reference genome can be used to compute a base-pair coverage curve and identify exon-exon junctions (split reads). Gene and exon count matrices are generated using annotation information providing the gene (green boxes) and exon (blue boxes) coordinates together with the base-level coverage curve. The reads spanning exon-exon junctions (jx) are used to compute a third count matrix that might include unannotated junctions (jx 3 and 4). Without using annotation information, expressed regions (orange box) can be determined from the base-level coverage curve to then construct data-driven count matrices. The following annotations are supported in recount3. See Annotation files section for direct links to the annotation files. 1.1 Human Annotations: Gencode v26 Gencode v29 RefSeq FANTOM6_cat ERCC SIRV 1.2 Mouse Annotations: Gencode v23 1.3 Study explorer You can also open the study explorer independently through shinyapps.io. 1.4 How to cite recount3 Thank you for your continued support of the ReCount family of projects!

Specifically, we used seqtk (Li 2020 (accessed August 18, 2020)), the idxstats subcommand of samtools, the output of STAR, our own megadepth tool, and featureCounts. We examine each in turn, listing the specific QC measures calculated be each. Monorail runs the seqtk fqchk command on input FASTQ files to collect base-quality and base-composition summaries for all sequencing cycles. We distill these into a few QC measures included with every summarized run in recount3. min_len: minimum read length max_len: maximum read length avg_len: average read length #distinct_quality_values: number of different quality scores present in the sequence run’s base qualities #bases: total number of bases across spots (not including both read mates if paired) %A: percent of bases that are A %C: percent of bases that are C %G: percent of bases that are G %T: percent of bases that are T %N: percent of bases that are N avgQ: weighted average over Phred quality scores present in the sequence run, where weights are the Phred quality values themselves errQ: negatively scaled log of the weighted average Phred quality scores present in the sequence run, where weights are the error probabilities associated with the Phred quality scores Monorail uses STAR to align RNA-seq reads in a spliced fashion to a reference genome, without using any annotation. Files output by STAR, particularly the Log.out and Log.final.out, report a number of measures that can be used for QC. We compile these into a number of QC measures included with every summarized run in recount3. Note that some of these measures are reported separately for the two ends of a paired-end read. We omit the second-end versions of these QC measures here for space reasons. From the STAR manual (version 2.7.2b): Log.final.out: summary mapping statistics after mapping job is complete, very useful for quality control. The statistics are calculated for each read (single- or paired-end) and then summed or averaged over all reads. Note that STAR counts a paired-end read as one read, (unlike the samtools flagstat/idxstats, which count each mate separately). Most of the information is collected about the UNIQUE mappers (unlike samtools flagstat/idxstats which does not separate unique or multi-mappers). Each splicing is counted in the numbers of splices, which would correspond to summing the counts in SJ.out.tab. The mismatch/indel error rates are calculated on a per base basis, i.e. as total number of mismatches/indels in all unique mappers divided by the total number of mapped bases. Some of the following definitions include text from the STAR manual/source code, reprinted here for convenience. Please see the STAR manual for more in depth information. %_of_chimeric_reads: Number of chimeric reads divided by number of input reads %_of_reads_mapped_to_multiple_loci: Number of reads mapped to multiple loci divided by number of input reads %_of_reads_mapped_to_too_many_loci: Number of reads mapped to (&gt; 10) loci divided by number of input reads %_of_reads_unmapped:_other: Reads are unmapped due to no acceptable seed/windows divided by number of input reads %_of_reads_unmapped:_too_many_mismatches: Number of reads where best alignment has more mismatches than max allowed number of mismatches divided by number of input reads %_of_reads_unmapped:_too_short: Number of reads where best alignment was shorter than min allowed mapped length divided by number of input reads all_mapped_reads: Total number of reads aligned average_input_read_length: Average length of a read average_mapped_length: Average length of an alignment deletion_average_length: Average length of a genomic deletion, i.e. genomic gaps deletion_rate_per_base: Genomic deletions per mapped base insertion_average_length: Average length of a genomic insertion, i.e. read gaps insertion_rate_per_base: Genomics insertions per mapped base mapping_speed_million_of_reads_per_hour: How fast it was to align this sample mismatch_rate_per_base_%: Mismatches per mapped base number_of_chimeric_reads: Total number of reads which were fragmented on aligning, e.g. fusion potential reads number_of_input_reads: Total number of reads input to STAR number_of_reads_mapped_to_multiple_loci: Number of reads mapped to multiple loci number_of_reads_mapped_to_too_many_loci: Number of reads mapped to (&gt; 10) loci number_of_reads_unmapped:_other: Number of reads left unmapped due to no acceptable seed/windows number_of_reads_unmapped:_too_many_mismatches: Number of reads where best alignment has more mismatches than max allowed number of mismatches number_of_reads_unmapped:_too_short: Number of reads where best alignment was shorter than min allowed mapped length number_of_splices:_at/ac: Number of canonical splices of AT-AC (and reverse) number_of_splices:_annotated_(sjdb): Number of splices found that were also in the annotation database number_of_splices:_gc/ag: Number of canonical splices of GC-AG (and reverse) number_of_splices:_gt/ag: Number of canonical splices of GT-AG (and reverse) number_of_splices:_non-canonical: Number of non-canonical splices, anything not GT-AG, AT-AC, GC-AG, or their reverse complement number_of_splices:_total: Total number of splices uniquely_mapped_reads_%: Number of reads which mapped to a single locus divided by number of input reads uniquely_mapped_reads_number: Number of reads which mapped to a single locus Monorail runs the samtools idxstats on the BAM file output by STAR to collect statistics about how many reads aligned to each chromosome in the genome assembly. This can be helpful in, for instance, confirming the sex of the individual sequenced based on alignments to sex chromosomes, or measuring effectiveness of ribosomal RNA depletion by considering the fraction of reads aligned to the mitochondrial genome. We compile these into a number of QC measures included with every summarized run in recount3: aligned_reads%.chrm: Percent of reads aligning to the mitochondrial genome. aligned_reads%.chrx: Percent of reads aligning to chromosome X. aligned_reads%.chry: Precent of reads aligning to chromosome Y. Monorail runs our megadepth tool on the BAM files output by STAR. The chief function is to convert BAM files to bigWig files that are then added to the recount3 archive. As megadepth performs this conversion, it also summarizes the amount of sequencing coverage within the intervals of a provided BED file representing a gene annotation. These quantifications can be useful for quality control, tell us, for example, what fraction of the coverage is within annotated genes. Fragment length distribution is based on a special read filter only applied for this purpose to be compatible with CSAW’s fragment counting approach (Lun and Smyth 2016), paired reads in a passing fragment must not be secondary, supplementary, have conflicting read order, be unmapped or be mapped on more than one chromosome.

This provides a second opinion on the quantifications produced by megadepth. While we have not yet found compelling examples where the megadepth and featureCounts outputs disagree, we keep summaries of the featureCounts quantifications as potential QC measures. exon_fc.all_%: exon_fc_count_all.assigned divided by all_mapped_reads (from STAR) exon_fc.unique_%: exon_fc_count_unique.assigned divided by uniquely_mapped_reads_number (from STAR) exon_fc_count_all.total: Total number of fragments, including multi-mappers, input to featureCounts exon_fc_count_all.assigned: Number of fragments, including multi-mappers, assigned by featureCounts to an exon exon_fc_count_unique.total: Total number of uniquely mapping fragments input to featureCounts exon_fc_count_unique.assigned: Number of uniquely mapping fragments assigned by featureCounts to an exon gene_fc.all_%: gene_fc_count_all.assigned divided by all_mapped_reads (from STAR) gene_fc.unique_%: gene_fc_count_unique.assigned divided by uniquely_mapped_reads_number (from STAR) gene_fc_count_all.total: Total number of fragments, including multi-mappers, input to featureCounts gene_fc_count_all.assigned: Number of fragments, including multi-mappers, assigned by featureCounts to a gene gene_fc_count_unique.total: Total number of uniquely mapping fragments input to featureCounts gene_fc_count_unique.assigned: Number of uniquely mapping fragments assigned by featureCounts to a gene Megadepth used to be called BamCount.↩︎ "],["bioconductor.html", "5 Bioconductor 5.1 recount3 5.2 snapcount 5.3 megadepth", " 5 Bioconductor R is an open source software programming language that has been widely used for studying gene expression data thanks in part to the Bioconductor project. You can install R for free from CRAN on macOS, Windows, and Linux operating systems. The Bioconductor community has defined common structures that enable users to store their data in common formats and analyzed through many different solutions (DOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3252). One such common format is the RangedSummarizedExperiment object from the SummarizedExperiment package that can then be used in downstream analayses of differential expression using packages such as DESeq2, edgeR, and limma. To facilitate the re-analysis of public expression data, we have provided several R/Bioconductor packages that interface with the recount3 data. These are: recount3 snapcount megadepth These packages can also benefit from using recount and derfinder, which we made in earlier phases of the ReCount project. 5.1 recount3 The following information is taken from the recount3 documentation.

Please continue to the users guide for more detailed information. 5.2 snapcount The following information is taken from the snapcount documentation. As stated in the documentation, snapcount provides access to data from the recount2 project, but it can also be used with the data from the recount3 project. To get started, we need to load the snapcount package into our R session. This will load all the required dependencies. library(&quot;snapcount&quot;) snapcount makes it easy to query the Snaptron web services, with results presented as RangedSummarizedExperiment objects. You can query measurements for genes, exons, splice junctions and coverage vectors from the RNA-seq samples indexed in Snaptron. Samples are organized into compilations (e.g. srav2) that altogether contain the same studies and summaries in the recount resource. Queries can be filtered to narrow the focus to particular genes or genomic intervals, to events with certain prevalence, to events that do or don’t appear in gene annotation, or to samples with particular metadata. snapcount complements the recount package, which also allows for searching by coordinates or by HUGO gene names. In general, recount works best when you are interested in all the genes, exons, or splice junctions in a study, whereas snapcount is best for queries over a particular subset of genes or intervals across all or most of the samples in recount2/Snaptron. The more specific your query, the faster and easier it will be to use snapcount. All the RNA-seq samples in the recount and Snaptron resources were analyzed using the Rail-RNA aligner. Rail produces spliced alignments that in turn produce coverage and junction-level summaries that are further processed to obtain the data in recount and Snaptron. Similar to the recount all coverage counts in Snaptron/snapcount are stored/retrieved as raw, un-normalized counts. 5.2.1 Basic queries A basic query returns a RangedSummarizedExperiment (RSE) object with one or more features (genes, exons, or splice junctions) as rowRanges. Raw coverage counts are returned as the counts assay in the RSE Full sample metadata is returned as the colData of the RSE Basic queries include: exon-exon splice junction counts: query_jx exon-level quantifications: query_exon genes-level quantifications: query_gene The Gencode v25 annotation defines what genes and exons can be queried (as in recount). For splice junctions, both annotated and novel junctions are queried at the same time unless one is explicitly filtered. Metadata columns will vary by compilation (e.g. TCGA vs. GTEx). Please be cautious with metadata. We strive to make it as complete and usable as possible, but it can still be incomplete, incorrect or inconsistently formatted (e.g. “age” in the srav2 compilation).

To get started, we need to load the megadepth package into our R session. This will load all the required dependencies. library(&quot;megadepth&quot;) Once we have the R package loaded, we need to install the Megadepth software. We can do so with install_megadepth(), which downloads a binary for your OS (Linux, Windows or macOS).2 We can then use with an example BigWig file to compute the coverage at a set of regions. ## Install the latest version of Megadepth install_megadepth(force = TRUE) ## The latest megadepth version is 1.1.0b ## megadepth has been installed to /github/home/bin Next, we might want to use megadepth to quantify the coverage at a set of regions of the genome of interest to us. Here we will use two example files that are include in the package for illustration and testing purposes. One of them is a bigWig file that contains the base-pair coverage information for a sample of interest and the second one is BED file which contains the genomic region coordinates of interest. So we first locate them. ## Next, we locate the example BigWig and annotation files example_bw &lt;- system.file(&quot;tests&quot;, &quot;test.bam.all.bw&quot;, package = &quot;megadepth&quot;, mustWork = TRUE ) annotation_file &lt;- system.file(&quot;tests&quot;, &quot;testbw2.bed&quot;, package = &quot;megadepth&quot;, mustWork = TRUE ) ## Where are they? example_bw ## [1] &quot;/usr/local/lib/R/host-site-library/megadepth/tests/test.bam.all.bw&quot; annotation_file ## [1] &quot;/usr/local/lib/R/host-site-library/megadepth/tests/testbw2.bed&quot; Once we have located the example files we can proceed to calculating the base-pair coverage for our genomic regions of interest. There are several ways to do this with megadepth, but here we use the user-friendly function get_coverage(). This function will perform a given operation op on the bigWig file for a given set of regions of interest (annotation). One of those operations is to compute the mean base-pair coverage for each input region. This is what we’ll do with our example bigWig file. ## We can then use megadepth to compute the coverage bw_cov &lt;- get_coverage( example_bw, op = &quot;mean&quot;, annotation = annotation_file ) bw_cov ## GRanges object with 4 ranges and 1 metadata column: ## seqnames ranges strand | score ## &lt;Rle&gt; &lt;IRanges&gt; &lt;Rle&gt; | &lt;numeric&gt; ## [1] chr10 0-10 * | 0.00 ## [2] chr10 8756697-8756762 * | 15.85 ## [3] chr10 4359156-4359188 * | 3.00 ## [4] GL000219.1 168500-168620 * | 1.26 ## ------- ## seqinfo: 2 sequences from an unspecified genome; no seqlengths get_coverage() returns an object that is familiar to GenomicRanges users, that is, a GRanges object that can be used with other Bioconductor software packages. This example is just the tip of the iceberg, as Megadepth and thus megadepth can do a lot of useful processing operations on BAM and bigWig files. Please continue to the users guide for more detailed information. Please check Megadepth for instructions on how to compile the software from source if the binary version doesn’t work for you.↩︎ "],["raw-files.html", "6 Raw Files 6.1 Data source vs collection 6.2 Annotation files 6.3 Project-level count files 6.4 Project-level metadata files 6.5 Sample-level BigWig files", " 6 Raw Files Explain the raw file formats we have and how they are organized 6.1 Data source vs collection A data source specifies where the data is hosted at, most commonly from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). A collection is a manually curated set of samples from one or more studies. A collection has a custom metadata file where the curator(s) can specify metadata variables for the collection. In other words: data_source: samples from the original data origin collection: manually selected samples with curated collection-specific sample metadata 6.2 Annotation files Here are the direct links in case you are interested in downloading the annotation files directly.

For genes and exons, we provide a file for each of the annotations. That is, for every project we provide: gene files: one count matrix per annotation exon files: one count matrix per annotation 3 exon-exon junction files: the sparse count matrix data in Matrix Market (MM) format, the small list of sample identifiers (IDs), and the exon-exon junctions coordinate information (RR file) All these files can be located with recount3::locate_url(). The following R code creates a table with links to the files for the default annotation for each organism.

These files can be used to re-quantify the expression levels with new annotations using the same reference genomes. They can also be used to explore un-annotated regions of the genome. For recount3 we suggest using the megadepth R/Bioconductor package (or the command-line version) available from https://bioconductor.org/packages/megadepth.

Currently we are focused on releasing the initial version of recount3. 9.1 Process your data While recount_pump contains code for generating recount3, if you want to use the Monorail RNA-seq processing pipeline (alignment/quantification) for your own data, we highly recommend that you start by looking at the monorail-external GitHub repository. It contains a very detailed README with instructions on how to install the software, download the annotation files, and process raw RNA-seq data (with some example files used for illustration purposes). In order to add your data to recount3, we will need all the raw files for your study. That is: the gene count text files for each annotation we support (organism-dependent) similarly, the exon count text files for each annotation the exon-exon junction files5 the five metadata files the bigWig files for each sample We will then need to organize your data into the directory structure expected by recount3. 9.2 Contribute your collections As described in the raw files section, collections involve creating a metadata file for a custom set of samples across one or more studies (typically more than one study). You can find some example collections at http://snaptron.cs.jhu.edu/data/temp/recount3/human/collections/. For example, http://snaptron.cs.jhu.edu/data/temp/recount3/human/collections/gtex_geuvadis/metadata/ contains two files: &lt;collection_name&gt;.custom.gz: gtex_geuvadis.custom.gz &lt;collection_name&gt;.recount_project.gz: gtex_geuvadis.recount_project.gz (optional!) These files include the 3 columns we use internally for identifying all samples: rail_id: used by Snaptron study: the project name. See recount3::available_projects() for supported options (or use your own custom recount3_url). external_id: typically the SRA run ID but each data source has different unique IDs, like TCGA which uses much longer sample IDs. 9.2.1 Collection metadata The &lt;collection_name&gt;.custom.gz can then contain any additional columns of interest. For example, in the recount-brain project we manually curated samples from 62 studies and standardized variables across the 62 studies. Here’s how the example collection metadata file looks like: read.delim( recount3::file_retrieve( &quot;http://snaptron.cs.jhu.edu/data/temp/recount3/human/collections/gtex_geuvadis/metadata/gtex_geuvadis.custom.gz&quot; ) ) ## 2021-02-11 00:36:50 caching file gtex_geuvadis.custom.gz. ## adding rname &#39;http://snaptron.cs.jhu.edu/data/temp/recount3/human/collections/gtex_geuvadis/metadata/gtex_geuvadis.custom.gz&#39; ## rail_id external_id study sequencing_type tissue ## 1 98371 ERR188021 ERP001942 bulk LCL ## 2 153881 GTEX-U3ZM-0826-SM-4DXU6.1 BLADDER bulk BLADDER This file has to be readble with R using the following code: utils::read.delim( file_path, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;, check.names = FALSE, quote = &quot;&quot;, comment.char = &quot;&quot; ) Since this is the main file that needs to be produced for adding a collection to recount3, if your collection involves data that is already present in recount3, it will be very easy for us to add it to our resource. Otherwise we will need the raw files for the corresponding new data. 9.2.2 Collection project location The second text file specifies the required information for locating the samples. While we had considered using this type of file, we don’t require it anymore. For historical purposes, this is how that file looked:6 read.delim( recount3::file_retrieve( &quot;http://snaptron.cs.jhu.edu/data/temp/recount3/human/collections/gtex_geuvadis/metadata/gtex_geuvadis.recount_project.gz&quot; ) ) ## 2021-02-11 00:36:51 caching file gtex_geuvadis.recount_project.gz. ## adding rname &#39;http://snaptron.cs.jhu.edu/data/temp/recount3/human/collections/gtex_geuvadis/metadata/gtex_geuvadis.recount_project.gz&#39; ## rail_id external_id study project organism ## 1 98371 ERR188021 ERP001942 ERP001942 Homo sapiens ## 2 153881 GTEX-U3ZM-0826-SM-4DXU6.1 BLADDER BLADDER Homo sapiens ## file_source metadata_source date_processed ## 1 data_sources/sra collections/gtex_geuvadis 2019-10-01 ## 2 data_sources/gtex collections/gtex_geuvadis 2019-11-01 Hm… I think this will be tricky if new exon-exon junctions are found in someone’s data which are absent in recount3.
