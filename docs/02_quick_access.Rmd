# Quick Access

The data from the `recount3` project is accessible through R/Bioconductor packages as well as raw files. You can access the data through:

* `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("recount3")`: this R/Bioconductor package retrieves the data from the [IDIES](https://idies.jhu.edu/) servers and builds `RangedSummarizedExperiment` objects by study that can be used with many Bioconductor analysis packages for downstream analyses (DOI: [10.1038/nmeth.3252](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3252)).
* `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("snapcount")`: this R/Bioconductor package also provides access to data from `recount2` and `recount3` through a query-based interface. 
* _raw files_: these are text files that are hosted by IDIES and can be used with other programming software outside of R.

As noted in the [Bioconductor chapter](#bioconductor), longer tutorials (called *vignette* documents in R/Bioconductor) showing how to install and use our R/Bioconductor packages are available from the Bioconductor landing pages (that is, the Bioconductor website for each package), such as the one called [`recount3` quick start guide](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/recount3/inst/doc/recount3-quickstart.html).

## Quick recount3

If you want to access the data `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("recount3")`, here's some R code that you can use. See the [Bioconductor chapter](#bioconductor) for the full output of these commands and more details.

```{r 'recount3_code', eval = FALSE}
## Install the recount3 R/Bioconductor package
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("recount3")

## Load recount3 R package
library("recount3")

## Find all available human projects
human_projects <- available_projects()

## Find the project you are interested in,
## here we use SRP009615 as an example
proj_info <- subset(
    human_projects,
    project == "SRP009615" & project_type == "data_sources"
)

## Create a RangedSummarizedExperiment (RSE) object at the gene level
rse_gene_SRP009615 <- create_rse(proj_info)

## Explore that RSE object
rse_gene_SRP009615
```

## Quick snapcount

If you want to access the data through queries such as a set of regions or annotation features instead of downloading the data at a project-level, we recommend using `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("snapcount")`. It is an R/Bioconductor package for interfacing with Snaptron's REST API. Here's some example code you can use to get started with `snapcount`.

```{r 'snapcount_code', eval = FALSE}
## Install the snapcount R/Bioconductor package
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("snapcount")

## Load snapcount R package
library("snapcount")

## snapcount can be used with either a procedural interface
query_jx(compilation = "gtex", regions = "CD99")
query_jx(compilation = "gtex", regions = "CD99", range_filters = samples_count == 10)

## or using the query-builder class
sb <- SnaptronQueryBuilder$new()
sb$compilation("gtex")$regions("CD99")$query_jx()
```

## Quick raw files

The raw `recount3` files are hosted by [IDIES](https://idies.jhu.edu/) and are publicly available. We separated every piece of information into its own file. These files can be accessed without using R through your own favorite programming solution. For example, the files for human study `SRP009615` annotated with GENCODE v26 are:
